        <h1>SURVIVE</h1>
       <p>Survive is a game of survival against dangerous foes looking to harm you.</p>
       <p>A dangerous being appears in a box,and you have to quickly click on it to kill it before you are harmed.</p>
       <p>Every time you successfully click on the dangerous being that appears, it is a hit, and you get 10 points.</p>
       <p>Every time you miss clicking on the dangerous being, it is considered a miss, and you get 0 point.</p>
       <p>If you have 3 misses, the game will be over.</p>
       <P>Upon successful completion of a level, you move to the next level, where the dangerous beings are faster.</P>
       <p>If you somehow survive all levels,I seriously doubt this!!!You would have completed the game!!!</p>
       <P>Good luck.You will need it!!!</P>
